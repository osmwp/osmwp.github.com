<h1 class="title">Mobile Widgets SDK manual</h1>


<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>
This part aims to describe the Mobile Widget SDK Plug-in. This plug-in, once
integrated in the Eclipse platform, provides tools for Mobile Widgets creation,
compilation, export and emulation.
</p>

<p>
The following points will be detailed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Creation of a Mobile Widget,</li>
<li>Project Preferences,</li>
<li>Running a Mobile Widget,</li>
<li>Exporting a Mobile Widget. </li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h1>Prerequisites</h1>

<p>
Before you install the plug-in, make sure that your development environment fits
the following requirements:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Java 1.5 or higher is installed. It must be a Java Development Kit (JDK),
    and can be downloaded here: <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp</a><br/>
    See <a href="installation_java.html">Java installation part</a>.</li>
<li>The version 3.5 of Eclipse is used. It can be downloaded here:
    <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/">http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/</a>.
    The folder tree where Eclipse is installed must not contain white spaces.<br/>
    See <a href="installation_eclipse.html">Eclipse installation part</a>.</li>
<li>Perl 5.10.0 is installed (optional: used for documentation generation only).
    It can be downloaded here: <a href="http://www.perl.com/download.csp">http://www.perl.com/download.csp</a>.</li>
</ul>
<br/>


<h1>Mobile Widget Creation</h1>

<p>
There are two ways to create a new Mobile Widget Project:
</p>

<h2>From the Toolbar</h2>

<p>
Click on the <b>New Widget Project</b> icon on the Toolbar (marked in red):<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_01.jpg" />
</p>

<h2>From the New Project menu</h2>

<p>
Go to <b>File &gt; New &gt; Project</b> in the top menu bar. In the wizards list,
go into the Mobile Widgets SDK folder and select Widget Project, then click on Next.<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_02.jpg" />
</p>




<h2>The New Mobile Widget Wizard</h2>

<p>
The new project wizard page is then displayed:<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_03.jpg" />
</p>

<h3>Widget Type</h3>

<p>
The Widget Type is defined here. As indicated on the wizard page:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Tiny Mobile Widgets are generic widgets which can be deployed on the whole
    range of handsets, in both widget and standalone modes.</li> 
<li>Mobile Widgets are also available in both widget and standalone modes. They
    allow backward compatibility and have less memory constraints than Tiny
    Mobile Widgets. As a result, they do not support low end handsets.</li>
</ul>
<br/>
	
<h3>Widget Configuration</h3>

<p>
First of all, the global parameters fields have to be filled in. Here is a short description of these parameters:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Project name (mandatory): The name of the project, as it will appear in the
    workspace.</li>
<li>Widget name (mandatory): The name of the new created Mobile Widget. It must
    begin with an upper-case alphabetic character, and can contain any
    alphabetic character or decimal digit.</li>
<li>Widget version (mandatory): The version number of the Mobile Widget. Default
    value: 1.0.0.</li>
<li>Widget description (optional): a short description of the widget.</li>
<li>Widget category: the widget category, selected in a list.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h3>VRML Model usage</h3>

<p>
The new Widget Project is built from an existing VRML model. These models are
functional and provide sample code. The VRML model to use is selected on the
second page of the wizard. A short description and a screenshot of the selected
item are displayed on the right.<br/>
When a model is selected, the Widget project creation is completed. You can
click on the Finish button.<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_04.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
A complete Widget Project is created. It is fully functional, and can be run
once created by using <b>Run As &gt; Mobile Widget</b>. Its sources can be used
as a starting point for another application, or just to provide code samples.
</p>

<h3>Widget Style</h3>

<p>
The third page of the creation wizard is optional.<br/>
The widget styles provide different pictures and allow the developer to
customize the widget design. By default, the style of the new widget will be the
style of the selected VRML model. However, this can be modified in this page.<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_05.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
An existing style can be used, or a new style can be created. A new style can be
derived from an existing style. A screenshot is displayed on this page, allowing
the developer to see how the selected style will look like.
</p>
<br/>

<h2>Project structure</h2>

<p>
A newly created project has the following structure:<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_06.jpg" />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The doc folder contains a screenshot of the widget.</li>
<li>The exports folder contains the files generated for different export
    configurations. Each export has its own subfolder.</li>
<li>The i18n folder contains languages files.</li>
<li>The SDK folder contains two symbolic links, to the protos and the styles
    bound to the selected widget type. It must not be modified (only by advanced
    users).</li>
<li>The src folder contains the project sources. All the project's source files
    must be saved in this folder.</li>
<li>The styles folder contains a subfolder named from the selected style (OWP in
    our case).</li>
<li>The tmp folder contains data generated during compilation.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Sometimes, a README.txt file is present. It contains a description of the model
as well as information that can be useful.
</p>

<p>
Depending on the selected widget type, the project icon in the Eclipse workspace
is different: orange if it is a Mobile Widget, cyan if it is a Tiny Mobile Widget.<br/>

</p>
<br/>

	
<h1>Preferences</h1>

<h2>Global preferences</h2>

<p>
In the top menu, go into <b>Window &gt; Preferences...</b> and select Mobile
Widgets. In this Preferences Page, you can configure the Perl path, and the
signing of Applets and MIDlets.
</p>

<p>
In order to generate the widgets' documentation, you must provide the path where
Perl is installed. Specify the path in the Perl bin directory field. By default,
it is set to C:\Perl\bin.
</p>

<p>
In order to sign Applets and MIDlets, you must provide a keystore and other
data, as an alias, a storepass and a keypass. If the checkbox is checked and
correct data are entered in the different fields, the Applets and/or the MIDlets
will automatically be signed when created.<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_08.jpg" />
</p>
<br/>


<h2>Project preferences (Properties)</h2>

<p>
The project preferences page allows modifying the Widget version and the Widget
style after the project creation.<br/>
Right click on the Widget project and select Properties, then select Widget
preferences.<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_09.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
The version and the style of the selected project are displayed, and can be
modified. When the OK button is pressed, the modification are submitted and
taken in account by the project.
</p>
<br/>

<h1>Running the Mobile Widget</h1>

<p>
There are three different ways to run the Mobile Widget:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are used to the Eclipse environment, you can run the widget in a
    standard way, from the Run Configurations dialog.</li>
<li>If you are new to Eclipse, you can configure and launch the widget from the
    Toolbar.</li>
<li>For a quick launch with default configuration, you can use the Run as… menu.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h2>Run Configuration</h2>

<p>
On the top menu, click on <b>Run &gt; Open Run Dialog...</b>. The following window is displayed:<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_10.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
In the configurations list, choose Mobile Widget Application. You can specify a
name for this configuration, in the Name field. By default, it will be named
New_configuration. Select a project on which the configuration will be applied
by clicking on the Browse… button.
</p>

<p>
In the Task group, select Compile and test. The Emulator group is enabled. There
are three configuration items:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean: check this box to clean the RMS entries on the emulator.</li>
<li>Current Language: by clicking the Select language button on the right, you
    can choose one of the available languages in the project (from the i18n folder).</li>
<li>Current Resolution: choose a resolution by clicking the Select size button.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Click on the Apply button to save your configuration, and then on the Run button
to launch it. The WRL sources are compiled for the current language and
resolution, and the emulator is launched.
</p>
<br/>

<h2>Run from the Toolbar</h2>

<p>
The fourth button of the Toolbar allows configuring Run and Export for the selected widget:<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_11.jpg" />

</p>
<ul>
<li>It wipes the RMS data and runs the widget on the emulator.</li>
<li>The default language and the default resolution are the ones selected in the Toolbar configuration screen.</li>
</ul> 
<br/>


<h1>Exporting the Mobile Widget</h1>

<p>
There are three different ways to export the Mobile Widget:
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are used to the Eclipse environment, you can export the widget from the Run Configurations dialog.</li>
<li>If you are new to Eclipse, you can export the widget from the Toolbar.</li>
<li>For quick single exports, you can use the context menu.</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h2>Run Configuration</h2>

<p>
On the top menu, click on <b>Run &gt; Open Run Dialog...</b> to display the Run Configurations dialog:<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_15.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
In the Task group, select Export Widget. The Package group is enabled: select one or several packages to create.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Package Applet: generate JAR files (in the exports/applet directory) and launch the applet in browser.</li>

The context menu can be accessed by right-clicking on the project (or on one of
its elements). Click on the Generate documentation item.<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_22.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
The documentation is generated in the doc folder of the project, and open in a
web browser.
</p>
<br/>

<h1>Add/remove project nature</h1>

<p>
A project obtained from repository check-out which contains all the mandatory
elements may not have the required Mobile Widget nature. In this case, the
options of the context menus, the Run Configuration and the Toolbar are not
available for the project. To convert such a project in a Mobile Widget or a
Tiny Mobile Widget project, use the Mobile Widgets SDK Tools:<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_23.jpg" />
</p>

<p>
Once the project converted, the related actions become available, and the needed
symbolic links are created. The project nature is indicated by the following
icon:  for Mobile Widget Project,  for Tiny Mobile Widget Project.
</p>

<p>
If you convert a project that should not have been, the nature can always be
removed by using the context menu (last item):<br/>
<img alt="Widgets SDK Manual" src="images/widgets_sdk/user_manual_24.jpg" />
</p>
